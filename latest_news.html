<h2 class="text_one">Manchest United Lose The Second Match Of The Season</h2>
<h3 class="text_two">Table toppers Brighton beat United 2-1 on Saturday to stay perfect in the Premier League after Joao Pedro scored a late winner in the fifth minute of added time. Brighton took the lead when Kaoru Mitoma received the ball on the left flank before his cross went through United's defence and into the six-yard box where Danny Welbeck stuck a leg out to score against his former club. Amad Diallo drew United level at the hour mark when he was put through on goal and the 22-year-old cut inside his marker before shooting, with the ball being deflected past keeper Jason Steele and into the net. With the game seemingly heading for a draw, Brighton's pressure paid off when Simon Adingra found space in the box and chipped the ball over United's defenders to an unmarked Pedro who headed home to give them their second win of the season.</h3>
<h4 class="more_text">Erik ten Hag has pointed the finger at his defence after Manchester United fell to a late defeat at Brighton.
Joao Pedro scored deep into injury time to seal a deserved 2-1 win on Saturday, after Amad Diallo had cancelled out Danny Welbeck's opener. "We didn't stop the cross," Ten Hag said. "There were three players. [Adingra is a] right-footed player, send him down the line, send him wide instead of letting him come in and let the cross.
"We have, of course, to talk about this."
Mason Mount was withdrawn at half-time and Ten Hag confirmed after the game that the midfielder had picked up a knock.
He added: "Mason has some problems, he had an issue so we took him out."</h4>
